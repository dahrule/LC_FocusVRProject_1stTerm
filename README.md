# VR-Diver-Coral-Nursery

Final project for the first term (Fall 2021) of the VR/AR certificate program at Lethbridge College. This was my first VR experience created with Unity. This was an individual project in which I designed, modeled, textured, and programmed the entire experience.

Summary: As a player, you'll take on the task of identifying, measuring, and planting corals from a coral nursery to hidden sites in the reef.

The experience seamlessly integrates technical elements of diving into the game mechanics, creating a truly immersive experience. For example, the time to complete the task is displayed on your virtual dive computer and represented as the no-decompression time. Similarly, the experience offers a unique locomotion mechanic in which the player waves his arms to swim, mimicking the feeling of describing a finning movement with your wrists or arms.

Overall, this VR experience offers an engaging and exciting way to learn about coral reef conservation while also enjoying the thrills of diving in a virtual world.
